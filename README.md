## Tools used

This game was developed using the Javascript library Kaboom.JS and Replit.

<strong>Kaboom</strong> is a Javascript library that helps you build games fast and smooth. It uses shortcuts for built in methods and actions to make game development easier.

<strong>Replit</strong> is a free IDE (integrated development environment) that allows users to write their own programs and code in dozens of different languages. While traditional IDEs are software programs downloaded to a computer, Repl.it is completely web browser-based and can be accessed from any internet-enabled device such as a phone, tablet, or computer.

## Objective

The objective of space invaders is to destroy all the aliens that are scrolling down the screen.  You win if you clear every enemy on the screen, you lose if the enemy touches your spaceship or gets past you on the game board.

## Challenges

This was my first experience using both kaboom.js and replit.  Midway through my build, using Kaboom on Replit moved from Beta to full launch.  A lot of functionality changed, and I had to debug a lot to get everything working again.
